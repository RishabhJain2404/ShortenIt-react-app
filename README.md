- **Dashboard:** Upon successful login, users are redirected to their personalized dashboard. Here, they can view their total number of created links, total clicks on those links, and a list of all their shortened URLs. The dashboard also includes a filter functionality to search for specific links and a "Create New Link" option to generate new shortened URLs.

- **Link Details Page:** Clicking on a specific link from the dashboard takes users to a detailed page. This page provides information about the original URL, the shortened URL, the date and time of creation, a QR code for easy scanning, and detailed statistics.
