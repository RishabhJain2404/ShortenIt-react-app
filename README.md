- **Dashboard:** Upon successful login, users are redirected to their personalized dashboard. Here, they can view their total number of created links, total clicks on those links, and a list of all their shortened URLs. The dashboard also includes a filter functionality to search for specific links and a "Create New Link" option to generate new shortened URLs.
